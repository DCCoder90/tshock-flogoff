# FLogoff

FLogoff is a fake logoff plugin for [TShock](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock) designed for admins to use to give other players the illusion that the admin is no longer on the server.


## TODO
* Send the "invalid player" message when another user attempts to TP to them
* Hide their name from the /playing list
